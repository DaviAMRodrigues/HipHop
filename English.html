            <h1>Graffiti</h1>
            <p>Graffiti, often considered a rebellious and vibrant form of artistic expression, is a cultural manifestation that transcends the boundaries between art, protest, and identity. Originating from urban streets and marginalized communities, graffiti has emerged as a visual voice that challenges social norms, making a bold and colorful statement.</p>
            <p>At the core of graffiti is the idea of taking public spaces and turning them into blank canvases to tell stories, express emotions, and convey messages. Unlike traditional art confined to galleries, graffiti invades public space, creating a direct dialogue with people who encounter it in their everyday environments.</p>
            <p>Graffiti artists, known as "writers" or "graffiti artists," employ a variety of techniques, styles, and materials to create their works. From bold tags and stylized letters to elaborate murals and detailed images, graffiti spans a wide range of visual forms. City walls, train carriages, and even abandoned buildings become improvised canvases where stories are told and visions are shared.</p>
